# DemoNinja

## About

Giving live code demos is a common requirement of BNR instructors and employees. Most demo scripts are passed around in plain text files -- but using these live as you run a demo can be inconvenient and error prone. 

DemoNinja is a iPad app that helps display the next steps of a demo in large, easy to see text while letting the instructor progress with simple taps and gestures. A script step may also include reference images to help remind the presenter where a widget they need to interact with is. Finally, if a script step contains some code the instructor needs to type in, that code will be made available via a companion Mac app that communicates with the iPad for simple pasting into place.
