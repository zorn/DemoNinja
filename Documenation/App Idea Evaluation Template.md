# App Idea Evaluation Template

## Pitch

Giving live code demos is a common requirement of BNR instructors and employees. Most demo scripts are passed around in plain text files -- but using these live as you run a demo can be inconvenient and error prone. 

The demo helper app is a iPad app that helps display next steps of a demo in large, easy to see text while letting the instructor progress with simple taps and gestures. A script step may also include reference images to help remind the presenter where a widget they need to interact with is. Finally, if a script step contains some code the instructor needs to type in, that code will be made available via a companion Mac app that communicates with the iPad for simple pasting into place.

## Unique 

> How groundbreaking is this idea?

Not extremely groundbreaking, and arguably very niche.

## Competition

> Who has competing solutions in the market place? Describe them. Pros, Cons.

Demo Monkey: https://github.com/wooster/DemoMonkey
Xcode: http://nshipster.com/xcode-snippets/
KeyGrip: http://cocoamanifest.net/articles/2014/04/announcing-keygrip-the-pasteboard-presentation-tool.html

The biggest con with any of these is the separation from the demo script and the code samples. That said some might consider 

## Market Size

> How big is the market for this idea? How much money can we look to make?

Very small market. Best to use as open source, promotion-ware.

# Underserved / Overserved

>  How much competition is there compared to the size of the market?

Compared to the market need, the companion is about right. Served appropriately.

## Domain Knowledge 

> How much domain knowledge is needed for this app? Do I have it? How do I get it?

Not much. I wouldn't say I know all of what I need but pretty confident I can learn it.

## Level of Effort 

> How hard will it be to execute on this idea?

Doable for clash, and not too hard to clean up for an open source release.


## Reachability 

>How accessible is the audience for this prepossessed solution. Are they liable to buy from an indie developer?

You might be able to sell this to a small group of people but prob best as Open Source project.

## Value 

> How much value are we providing. Is this a need or want. Can people get by without it?

I'd say it's a want not a need. Yes people have options to get around this.

## Cost of Maintenance

> Are there long term maintenance costs related to this solution? Server costs? How much?

Nope.

## Outside Forces 

> What will effect this solution that I can not control?

App Store approval might be a little hard. The Mac-app part would have to be optional.

## Platform Restrictions

> What are they? Do we need to verify weâ€™ll get through review sooner than later?

Maybe some on the pasteboard (pasting from iOS?)

## Obvious Benefits 

> How obvious is the value we are providing. How much time does it take to sell someone that that have the problem, and then our solution is the fix for it.

It's a quick pitch and fairly low complexity to enter and try out.

## Sustainability 

> How will the market / environment change over time. How does this effect the product?

More tech demos? Flat demand. Could promote to conference organizers?
